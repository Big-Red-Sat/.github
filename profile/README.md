# Big Red Sat

Welcome to the Big Red Sat team, we are a multi-disciplinary team of middle school, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in the Nebraska public school system and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  We are a sub-group within the UNL Aerospace Club's Aerospace eXperimental Payloads group that has been working on high altitude balloon launches and a 1U CubeSat, which is currently in-orbit.
